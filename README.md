# Hi there, I'm Irene Gathoni Njogu!

I'm a **Software Engineer** specializing in developing robust, scalable **Backend Systems** and **Intelligent Applications**.

My expertise lies in translating business requirements into well-engineered solutions using Python (FastAPI, Flask), PHP (Laravel), and SQL. I focus on clean architecture, secure API design, and leveraging applied machine learning to deliver measurable project impact.
