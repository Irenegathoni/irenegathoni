# Hi there, I'm Irene Gathoni Njogu!

I'm a **Software Engineer** specializing in developing robust, scalable **Backend Systems** and **Intelligent Applications**.

[cite_start]My expertise lies in translating business needs into well-engineered solutions using Python (FastAPI, Flask), PHP (Laravel), and SQL[cite: 6, 10, 11]. [cite_start]I focus on clean architecture, secure API design, and leveraging applied machine learning to deliver measurable impact[cite: 6, 7, 14].

## Fun Facts
- I love crocheting and often code with yarn in one hand and coffee in the other
- I once bought a toy camera by accident and still use it like it’s vintage gold
