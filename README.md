# Hi there, I'm Irene Gathoni

I'm a Data Analyst based in Nyahururu, Kenya, passionate about transforming raw data into clear, actionable insights. I use tools like Excel, Power BI, Python, and SQL to explore patterns, build dashboards, and solve real-world problems — one project at a time.

## What I Do
- Analyze datasets across domains like music, finance, and housing
- Build end-to-end data projects with storytelling at the core
- Learn and apply machine learning techniques to deepen analysis
- Practice NLP with a creative twist (sentiment analysis, LLM integration, etc.)

## I'm Currently Focused On
- Building a portfolio of diverse data projects
- Exploring how data can drive better decisions in creative and business spaces
- Mastering Power BI and Python

## Fun Facts
- I love crocheting and often code with yarn in one hand and coffee in the other
- I once bought a toy camera by accident and still use it like it’s vintage gold
